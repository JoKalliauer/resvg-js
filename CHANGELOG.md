## [Unreleased]
### Added

- feat: upgrade to resvg 0.20.0(tiny-skia to 0.6.2).
- chore: add oslllo-svg2 to the examples and bench.

## [1.2.0] - 2021-12-25

### Added

- feat: upgrading to napi-rs v2.
- feat: support Android armv7(@resvg/resvg-js-android-arm-eabi).

### Changed

- fix: default_font_family changed from Times New Roman to Arial.
  This is closer to the default rendering font in the browser.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-11-11

### Added

- feat: implement `renderAsync()` function. By @Brooooooklyn

  We have made a major upgrade to napi-rs, from v1 to 2.x alpha. This allows better support for asynchronous binding and automatic generation of TypeScript definitions. Now you can enjoy `async/await`.

  ```js
  const { renderAsync } = require('@resvg/resvg-js')

  async function main() {
    const pngData = await renderAsync(/* SVG string or buffer */)
  }
  ```

- feat: The input to the `render()` and `renderAsync()` functions supports buffer.
- feat: improved webpack support, no more need `@node-rs/helper` dependency.

  The `@node-rs/helper` is convenient to load native binary cross platform and cpu arch. But it's not friendly to [`webpack`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [`vercel/nft`](https://github.com/vercel/nft) and [`vercel/ncc`](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) because the logic is too dynamic.

- feat: add `example/compare.js`.

### Changed

- fix: the default font no longer throws an error if it is not found, it changes to a warning.
- chore: benchmark adds tests for svg icons and other improvements.
- chore: upgrade Rust Edition to 2021.

## [1.0.4] - 2021-10-19

### Added

- feat: `background` option supports alpha channel, currently only supports [CSS Colors 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/#colorunits).

  CSS color parse depends on [svgtypes](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgtypes/commit/266ee2caff9bd6a75d9a63b6e9850554f6de87b4).

```js
render(svgString, {
  // Support
  background: 'rgba(77, 25, 230, .8)',
  background: 'rgb(77, 25, 230, .8)',
  background: 'rgba(77%, 25%, 230%, .8)',
  background: 'hsla(255, 80%, 50%, .8)',
  background: 'hsl(255, 80%, 50%, .8)',
  // Not support
  background: 'rgb(77 25 230 / 80%)',
  background: 'rgb(77 25 230 / .8)',
  background: 'hsl(255deg 80% 50% / 80%)',
})
```
